// Everything this app knows about the chain. There is no backend: the browser
// reads the public MultiversX API directly, so two rules shape this file.
//
// 1. The API allows about two requests per second per IP, and that IP is the
//    visitor's own. A safe page needs a dozen reads, so requests go through a
//    small queue with a cache rather than firing at once.
// 2. Reads are cheap but not free. Anything already fetched in the last minute
//    is reused, which makes moving between the list and a safe feel instant.

// stuck on "..." and the browser retrying nothing. So: a token bucket paces the
// calls, refusals are retried with a growing wait, and answers are remembered.
